# PCMG
Official Pytorch implementation of the paper "PCMG:3D point cloud human motion generation based on self-attention and transformer".

To ensure the code runs smoothly, you need to install emd from https://github.com/daerduoCarey/PyTorchEMD and place it in the evaluate\P4Transformer folder. Similarly, install P4Transformer from https://github.com/daerduoCarey/PyTorchEMD and place it in the utils\emd folder.
