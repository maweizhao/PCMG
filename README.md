To ensure the code runs smoothly, you need to install emd from https://github.com/daerduoCarey/PyTorchEMD and place it in the utils\emd folder.

Similarly, install P4Transformer from https://github.com/daerduoCarey/PyTorchEMD and place it in the evaluate\P4Transformer folder.And copy temp\PCMG_classfier.py to evaluate\P4Transformer\models folder.
